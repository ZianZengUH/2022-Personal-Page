## Exploring The New Horizon: Javascript - A Simple but Powerful Language 

Although I have previous experiences with other languages like C, Java, and Python, I am completely new in the world of Javascript or any language that is leaning toward the front-end field. Based on my experience with the tutorial and practices in Free Code Camp, I figured that Javascript is indeed very similar to other languages like Java and Python, so I was able to grasp it at a rather quick pace. 

Despite that, there are still many things to learn, in both syntax and features sides. Although I have heard from others that Javascript is not a great language, I found out Javascript is in fact a concise and simple language when I was learning the units of Basic JavaScript and ES6 in Free Code Camp. It is way easier and faster to write code compared with C and Java. I think it is at the same level as Python and even in some cases, it may be simpler than Python when it comes to writing codes. I am very enjoying its functionalities and easier access to things with a rather simple syntax so far, so I will consider Javascript as a good language to learn from both a student and a software engineering perspective.

## Athletic Software Engineering & WODs

For athletic software engineering, it kind of made me stressed when I first heard about it because I am the kind of person who easily gets stressed out when there is time pressure especially when there is only a short amount of time to begin with or left. I find the practice WODs to be useful so far because I can experience what is going to be like when I take a real WOD, even though I have not done a real WOD yet. If the real WOD is very similar to the practice WODs, then I will be much more confident and less stressed after going through the practice WODs. I think this style of learning is new to me, and it is interesting and stressful as well. However, if the real WOD is a similar type of practice WODs and it is not an out-of-bound type of question that we havenâ€™t learned before which means it is possible for us to finish the WOD in a comfortable time after practice, then the stress factor can be reduced greatly. If so, I think this learning style will work for me and I think it is a great opportunity to simulate the interview situation.

Overall, I have had a great experience so far and I am looking forward to learning more about Javascript and software engineering in this class.
